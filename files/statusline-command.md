# Shared Claude/Codex statusline

The Claude and Codex commands are thin provider adapters around the same shell
libraries and lazy caches. Claude keeps its three-line layout. Codex displays
those same three lines as a one-line carousel, advancing every four seconds.

## Runtime layout

Bootstrap deploys shared code and state under ~/opt/bootstrap-home/statusline/:

    lib/                         shared cache, formatting, and refresh scripts
    state/static/hostname        immutable short hostname
    state/static/host-color      immutable deterministic terminal color
    state/system/metrics         used GiB, total GiB, percent
    state/providers/claude       5h percent/reset, 7d percent/reset
    state/providers/codex        5h percent/reset, 7d percent/reset
    state/git/cwd/.../local      local Git snapshot for that cwd
    state/git/cwd/.../remote     remote Git snapshot for that cwd
    locks/                       atomic refresh locks
    logs/statusline.log          bounded shared refresh/write event log
    logs/statusline.log.1        previous log after 1 MiB rotation

Dynamic value files use ASCII file-separator delimiters and have a sibling
.timestamp containing their refresh epoch. Renderers read both with Bash
built-ins. Only the provider JSON payload requires jq.

## Lazy stale-while-revalidate flow

1. Read the existing value and timestamp.
2. If fresh, render it without starting a refresher.
3. If stale, try an atomic mkdir lock.
4. If another session owns the lock, immediately render the stale value.
5. The lock winner runs the relevant refresher synchronously with a hard timeout.
6. Success atomically replaces value and timestamp; failure keeps stale data.
7. A stale lock is atomically renamed to quarantine before removal.

There is no polling daemon or scheduler. Work happens only for data currently
being displayed, and sessions share machine-, provider-, and cwd-scoped
results.

The shared log records cache refresh/write events for both providers, including
failure exit codes, safe stderr, and stale-cache age. It deliberately does not
log every render: at 30 sessions and a four-second interval that would create
roughly 650,000 lines per day and add avoidable I/O. Epoch timestamps keep the
hot-path logger independent of another `date` subprocess.

| Cache | Scope | TTL | Refresh timeout |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Hostname/color | machine | static | none |
| Memory | machine | 30s | 1s |
| Claude quotas | Claude account | 60s | 5s |
| Codex quotas | Codex account | 60s | payload update |
| Local Git | exact cwd | 8s | 1s |
| Remote Git | exact cwd | 30s | 1s |

Claude quotas use the OAuth usage endpoint. Codex contributes its latest
payload snapshot to the shared provider cache because no separate stable local
quota endpoint has been established.

## Source files

- statusline-cache.sh: paths, freshness, locking, timeouts, and atomic writes.
- statusline-format.sh: shared colors, bars, limits, and Git formatting.
- statusline-refresh-*.sh: one bounded refresh attempt, without cache policy.
- statusline-usage-fetch.sh: one Claude quota API attempt.
- statusline-command.sh: Claude adapter and multiline layout.
- codex-statusline-command.sh: Codex adapter and one-line layout.
- modules/statusline_cache.sh: installation and legacy-cache migration.

## Offline testing

Set STATUSLINE_RUNTIME_DIR to a temporary directory and STATUSLINE_LIB_DIR to
this repository's files/ directory, then pipe a captured provider payload into
the corresponding renderer. The first render may refresh stale data; subsequent
Codex renders should start only Bash and one payload jq. That jq also supplies
the refresh epoch used for cache freshness and carousel selection.
